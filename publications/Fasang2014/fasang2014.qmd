## Abstract

Research about parental effects on family behavior focuses on 
intergenerational transmission: that is, whether children show the same family 
behavior as their parents. This focus potentially overemphasizes similarity 
and obscures heterogeneity in parental effects on family behavior. In this 
study, we make two contributions. First, instead of focusing on isolated focal 
events, we conceptualize parents' and their children's family formation 
holistically as the process of union formation and childbearing between ages 
15 and 40. We then discuss mechanisms likely to shape these intergenerational 
patterns. Second, beyond estimating average transmission effects, we 
innovatively apply multichannel sequence analysis to dyadic sequence data on 
middle-class American families from the Longitudinal Study of Generations 
(LSOG; N = 461 parent-child dyads). The results show three salient 
intergenerational family formation patterns among this population: a strong 
transmission, a moderated transmission, and an intergenerational contrast 
pattern. We examine what determines parents' and children's likelihood to 
sort into a specific intergenerational pattern. For middle-class American 
families, educational upward mobility is a strong predictor of moderated 
intergenerational transmission, whereas close emotional bonds between parents 
and children foster strong intergenerational transmission. We conclude that 
intergenerational patterns of family formation are generated at the 
intersection of macro-structural change and family internal psychological 
dynamics.
