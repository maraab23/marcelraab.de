    "text": "Abstract\nObjective To examine how mothers’ and fathers’ time allocation for routine housework changes when the last child moves out of the family household. Background During the transition to the empty nest, parental households are reduced to the situation before parenthood. Mothers and fathers are released from their direct parenting roles and parental time binds. This gradual transition creates a context in which housework time allocation is likely to be rearranged. Methods Changes in mothers’ and fathers’ absolute and relative routine housework hours were estimated with longitudinal fixed effects regression models, using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (1991–2020) on 890 households experiencing the transition to the empty nest. Results Mothers’ reduced their time for routine housework by 9 minutes on regular weekdays at the transition to the empty nest, whereas fathers’ routine housework hours were largely unaffected when the last child moved out of the parental household. Mothers’ routine housework share was slightly below 80% in the years around this event. Separate analyses for mothers with different education revealed only minor variations in the gendered trajectories of housework time. In sum, mothers continued to do the majority of housework in this phase of the life course despite some slight convergence. Conclusion The transition to the empty nest contributes slightly to the life-course convergence of housework time and, thus, similar to all major life-course transitions following the birth of children, tends to reduce housework inequality in couples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitation\n\n\n\n\n\nSchulz, F., & Raab, M.

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nIn recent decades, childlessness has increased across many European countries. In addition to socioeconomic characteristics, having a partner is considered a prerequisite in most fertility studies. Yet, still little is known about the partnership biographies of childless women and men. We assess the heterogeneity in the partnership trajectories of childless persons in Germany and explore compositional differences of partnership trajectories by gender and education. We use data from the German Family Panel to reconstruct partnership biographies reflecting the occurrence and frequency of different partnership states (singleness, living apart together, cohabitation, marriage). The sample comprises women and men born 1971–1973 whose life courses are observed from age 18–40. Applying sequence and cluster analysis, we identify five patterns of partnership trajectories: (1) ‘Marriage’ (14.6%); (2) ‘Long-term cohabitation’ (11.8%) with one partner; (3) ‘Serial cohabitation’ (15.6%); (4) ‘LAT’ (18.8%), long-term/multiple living-apart-together relationships; and (5) ‘Single’ (39.3%), long-term singleness. Men are overrepresented in the ‘Single’ cluster, especially if highly educated. Women are more often married and more likely to experience long-lasting singleness or multiple LAT episodes when being highly educated. We speculate that theories predicting high levels of childlessness in contexts where gender norms and work-family policies do not account for the increasing gender equality in education and labor force participation might also explain differences in the pathways leading to childlessness. Generally, our findings point at a more elaborate conceptualization of childlessness that moves away from a binary cross-sectional indicator and set the ground for future cross-national comparisons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitation\n\n\n\n\n\nRaab, M., & Struffolino, E.

This measure builds on previous work by Dreher, Lockwood and Redoano, the OECD and Kearney, but extends it by additional dimensions and indicators that represent central facets of a genuine sociological concept of globalization. The article first describes in detail the multidimensional nature of the globalization process and then develops an overall sociological index of globalization, which the authors call GlobalIndex. This index covers the development of globalization in 97 different countries from 1970 to 2002. Using the GlobalIndex, the authors describe the development of globalization on a worldwide scale as well as for different country contexts. Finally, they include the GlobalIndex as an explanatory variable in two micro-level longitudinal analyses of labour market transitions during the early career period in Germany and the UK.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitation\n\n\n\n\n\nRaab, M., Ruland, M., Schönberger, B., Blossfeld, H.-P., Hofäcker, D., Buchholz, S., & Schmelzer, P.

Current data confine our answers to these questions to solidarity and transmission in the immediate family, overlooking other relatives who play a significant role in socialization, social integration, social support, and the reproduction of social status and inequality.\nObjective: This article presents the KINMATRIX project, a novel comparative survey that collected extensive data on a wide array of family members, moving beyond the traditional focus on the immediate family.\nMethods: The KINMATRIX data map out families as ego-centric networks of younger adults aged 25 to 35, including their parents, grandparents, siblings, aunts, uncles, cousins, and step- or half-relatives. The data prepared for scientific use include N = 12,438 egos (anchor-respondents) and N = 252,278 alters (anchor–kin dyads) in 10 countries (Denmark, Finland, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Sweden, United Kingdom, United States).\nContribution: KINMATRIX contributes to research infrastructure by offering detailed relational and attribute data collected on family networks, covering a wide range of relatives and diverse family forms. These data reflect the complexity of contemporary families and add to our understanding of key family processes, such as solidarity and transmission.

    "text": "Abstract\nPrevious studies of parent-child reciprocity have focused either on the long term (generalized exchange over the life course) or on the short term (concurrent exchange in later life). The purpose of this research was to investigate the linkage between both temporal patterns of reciprocity within an integrative conceptual framework. We assessed whether long-term and short-term reciprocity operated as interdependent mechanisms that initially selected and subsequently relieved intergenerational caregiving relationships. We used data from the Asset and Health Dynamics Among the Oldest Old study (AHEAD) provided by frail, single-living parents of at least two children (N = 1010 respondents comprising 3768 parent-child dyads). Fixed-effects conditional logit models estimated between-sibling differences in assistance provided to parents, measured by instrumental help (i.e., assistance with IADLs) and hands-on care (i.e., assistance with ADLs). Key predictors were two measures of financial transfers given to children referring to longer and shorter recall periods. Receiving earlier and current financial transfers increased adult children’s propensity to support their parents in later life. The effect of earlier transfers pertained to help rather than care whereas the reverse was true for the effect of current transfers. We found no evidence for a linkage between long-term and short-term reciprocity. Overall, the results indicate that adult children might balance long-term support accounts relative to their siblings, suggesting an intra-generational orientation on equity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitation\n\n\n\n\n\nLeopold, T., & Raab, M.

First, instead of focusing on isolated focal events, we conceptualize parents’ and their children’s family formation holistically as the process of union formation and childbearing between ages 15 and 40. We then discuss mechanisms likely to shape these intergenerational patterns. Second, beyond estimating average transmission effects, we innovatively apply multichannel sequence analysis to dyadic sequence data on middle-class American families from the Longitudinal Study of Generations (LSOG; N = 461 parent-child dyads). The results show three salient intergenerational family formation patterns among this population: a strong transmission, a moderated transmission, and an intergenerational contrast pattern. We examine what determines parents’ and children’s likelihood to sort into a specific intergenerational pattern. For middle-class American families, educational upward mobility is a strong predictor of moderated intergenerational transmission, whereas close emotional bonds between parents and children foster strong intergenerational transmission. We conclude that intergenerational patterns of family formation are generated at the intersection of macro-structural change and family internal psychological dynamics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitation\n\n\n\n\n\nFasang, A.

    "text": "Abstract\nThis paper proposes a process-oriented, life course perspective on intergenerational mobility by comparing the early socioeconomic trajectories of siblings to those of unrelated persons. Based on rich Finnish register data (N = 21,744), the findings show that social origin affects not only final outcomes at given points in the life course but also longitudinal socioeconomic trajectories from ages 17 to 35 in early adulthood. We contribute to previous literature in three ways. First, we show that there is a pronounced similarity in the early socioeconomic trajectories of siblings. This similarity is stronger for same-sex siblings and stronger for brothers than for sisters. Second, we show that sibling similarity in full trajectories cannot be reduced to similarity in outcomes, i.e., siblings are not only more similar in the final outcomes that they obtain but also in the pathways that lead them to these outcomes. Third, our findings support that sibling similarity follows a U-shaped pattern by social class, i.e., similarity is especially strong in disadvantaged trajectories, weak among middle-class young adults, and increases again within the most advantaged trajectories. We conclude that measures of social mobility that concentrate on final outcomes are at risk of underestimating the association between social origin and destination because social inequalities are formed across the life course, not just at the end of specific life phases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitation\n\n\n\n\n\nKarhula, A., Erola, J., Raab, M., & Fasang, A.

The authors used data from 6 waves (1998-2008) of the Health and Retirement Study, selecting a sample of families (N=641 parents comprising N=2,452 parent-child dyads) in which they observed at least 1 adult child becoming a caregiver to a previously self-sufficient parent. Among cost-related factors, this transition was predicted primarily by between-sibling differences in previous geographical distances to the parent and, to a lesser extent, competing demands in work and family spheres. The indicators for caregiving commitments showed the importance of reciprocity, path dependency, and parental expectations as motivational forces affecting the process of caregiver selection among adult children.

We contribute to this literature with a novel research design that combines sibling comparisons and sequence analysis to analyze longitudinal family-formation trajectories of siblings and unrelated persons. This allows us to scrutinize in a more rigorous way whether sibling similarity exists in family-formation trajectories and whether siblings’ shared background characteristics, such as parental education and early childhood family structure, can account for similarity in family formation. We use Finnish register data from 1987 through 2007 to construct longitudinal family-formation trajectories in young adulthood for siblings and unrelated dyads (N = 14,257 dyads). Findings show that family formation is moderately but significantly more similar for siblings than for unrelated dyads, also after controlling for crucial parental background characteristics. Shared parental background characteristics add surprisingly little to account for sibling similarity in family formation. Instead, gender and the respondents’ own education are more decisive forces in the stratification of family formation. Yet, family internal dynamics seem to reinforce this stratification such that siblings have a higher probability to experience similar family-formation patterns. In particular, patterns that correspond with economic disadvantage are concentrated within families. This is in line with a growing body of research highlighting the importance of family structure in the reproduction of social inequality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitation\n\n\n\n\n\nRaab, M., Fasang, A.

OBJECTIVE We take a life-course perspective to identify typical joint trajectories of functional limitations and depression in the last eight years before death. Our objective is to assess whether there is only a linear association between functional limitations and depression or if we also find groups marked by high and increasing functional limitations but low depression, and vice versa. METHODS Data from 10 waves of the Health and Retirement Study that cover US Americans who died between 2003-2014 are analyzed with sequence, cluster, and multinomial logistic regression methods. RESULTS Results show five typical trajectories of joint functional limitations and depression. Corroborating previous findings, three groups support a linear positive relationship between functional limitations and depression. Beyond previous research, we find two resilient groups of medium and high functional limitations combined with stable low depression. The five groups are highly stratified by social status, gender, marital status, and subjective life expectancy reported at the beginning of the trajectories. CONCLUSION Physical and mental health trajectories at the end of life are not only linearly associated. Medium and high functional limitations go along with a polarized pattern of either stable high or stable low depression.CONTRIBUTION The nonlinear relationship between functional limitations and depression in the last years of life represented by the ‘Resilient’ groups of medium and high functional limitations with low depression have gone largely unnoticed in previous research and should be investigated in future studies.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitation\n\n\n\n\n\nRaab, M., Fasang, A., & Hess, M.

As a result, key phenomena remain insufficiently understood, including the importance of extended kin, contrasts between kinship lines, and cross-national differences. Notably, extended kin provide a unique “strength in numbers” that can enhance social transmission, integration, and support.\nMethod We analyzed data from anchor respondents aged 25–35 (N = 11,788 anchors; 239,220 anchor-kin dyads) collected in seven Western countries (Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Sweden, United Kingdom, and United States). Kinship networks included a large array of nuclear, extended, and complex kin (on average, 20 kin per anchor). We used descriptive methods to examine retrospective, current, and prospective assessments of kin ties across four measures: importance, closeness, contact, and support. \nResults We report three main findings: First, extended kin are central to younger adults’ lives, representing at least half of the family members they are emotionally close to, regularly contact, and deem important. Second, kinship networks are matrilineally tilted. Maternal kin are emotionally closer, more frequently contacted, considered more important, and more supportive. Third, cross-national comparisons reveal both similarities and notable differences, with the United States and Sweden showing elevated importance of extended and complex kin and Italy exhibiting higher social integration with nuclear and extended kin.\nConclusion Data on kinship networks can significantly advance our understanding of key family phenomena.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitation\n\n\n\n\n\nLeopold, T., Raab, M., Becker, C.

Background From a life-course perspective, establishing an own household is one of the key markers of the transition to adulthood. Leaving home is associated with new responsibilities concerning the organization of everyday life, including routine housework, and provides a new context for gendered behavior.  Methods Hours for routine housework were estimated with longitudinal fixed effects regression models, using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (1991–2020) on 911 women and 721 men, aged 18–32, who moved to an own couple or non-couple household.  Results During the transition to an own household, young adult women increased their time for routine housework by 18 min per day. Young adult men’s increase was larger with 21 min per day. The gender gap in routine housework hours widened when young adults moved into couple households but showed a converging pattern when they moved into non-couple households.  Conclusion Women continue to do more routine housework than men in early adulthood, although moving into non-couple settings tends to decrease gender inequality on average.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitation\n\n\n\n\n\nSchulz, F., & Raab, M.
