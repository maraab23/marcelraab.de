:::{#about-content}

I am Senior Researcher at the State Institute for Family Research at the University of Bamberg and Deputy Managing Director of the [Journal of Family Research](https://ubp.uni-bamberg.de/jfr/index.php/jfr).

Previously, I worked as research assistant at the National Educational Panel Study and the Professorship of Demography at the University of Bamberg, as research fellow in the research group Demography and Inequality at the WZB Berlin Social Science Center, and Assistant Professor for Sociology in the Department of Sociology at the University of Mannheim. In 2011 I was a visiting pre-doctoral fellow at the Center for Research on Inequalities and the Life Course (CIQLE) at Yale University, New Haven. In 2014, I completed my PhD ("Family Effects on Family Formation") at the University of Bamberg.
